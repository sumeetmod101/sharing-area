We are currently in Japan and struggling with local agents to get our samples out of the Country. Our gaseous testing is due on 15 Sep 21, particulates in Mar 22.\n\nI have read the relevant parts of BR 2000(89) and DStan 68-284/3 and both point towards the routine for returning samples to the UK for testing. Neither policies seem to explicitly preclude the testing of breathing air samples using a local laboratory, so could you please advise if this is something we could pursue, i.e. could a local lab, armed with the DStan, test our air samples and provide certification that the samples met the DStan? Our preferred option very much remains to return the samples to the UK, but we are reaching a point where we need to explore all options, hence my question.\n\nLook forward to your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSteve Ray\n\nLieutenant Commander Royal Navy\nMarine Engineer Officer\n\nHMS RICHMOND | BFPO 375 | A  Deo et Rege – From God and the King\nGangway / Bridge: 07816 348977 | MEO: 07816 349386\nDii (OS): HMSRCMD-ME-HOD-MEO | LC2 (S): RCMD-SO2N4ME-GS2\nCiv: hmsrcmd-me-hod-meo@mod.uk\n\n \n\n??

Possibly that of the TCU (V) Operating Software Update to the Compact Flash Cards iaw PROGRAM ASSEMBLY NAME AND DESCRIPTION: TCU (V) Release 3.6 (ATLASUK/UWS/09/074); as this “Status Warning” has not been observed previous, only after the update was loaded.\r\nThe following 3 faults have been observed as the continuous 3 errors:\r\n1. smcstiu1swnet1\r\n2. tcuaswnet1\r\n3. tcubswnet1\r\nIn addition and possibly the cause of these errors the SMCS CEN1 has come up in error (whether it has been the Master or Slave Node) to escalate the count saying that CEN1 is down! This error on SMCS however maybe due to SPOT (Spearfish Onboard Trainer) being loaded onto the SMCS system as the loading of this software has been observed to be detrimental to the functionality of SMCS!\r\nAnother point to consider is that when all Periscopes are powered up (3 in number), these are also flagged up as being in error and need to be acknowledge and removed to history post powering down; unless they cause Zenoss to Lock-up. Despite these events being flagged up, the system appears to be operating correctly. This may not have been previously seen as prior to deploying on a Patrol; all masts remained powered up at all times.\r\n\r\nFollowing these early problems and observation CEN1 (Central Node) was displaying IP Address DOWN and SMCSTIU1SWNET1 Down on Zenoss (in addition CEN1 could not be pinged using the CMD prompt). \r\nThis led to the maintainers to believing that the defect resided within the TIU (TaLAN Interface Unit) which sits in the SMCS architecture and allows SMCS to talk to the TaLAN backbone.\r\nTherefore a TIU reconfiguration was conducted on SMCS, the result of which made no difference to the error being seen.\r\nThere after SPOT was removed from SMCS and said system was monitored to see if the removal of SPOT made any difference to the errors.\r\nThis in turn led to a delay in prosecuting this defect further. After 11 days and only the observation of two status warnings (that of CEN1 and SMCSTIU1SWNET1 Down on Zenoss) a CEN changeover was conducted (as the maintainers had clearly proven SPOT to be detrimental to the operating of SMCS but not that of the errors seen on TaLAN). This CEN change over was successful but the links on SMCS (Positional Data, Depth, Compass and Log) could not be seen; even after the TCU (TaLAN Conversation Unit) were reset. \r\nThis led the maintainers to question whether there was an inherent problem/ defect within the TIU, even though it has been successfully reconfigured.\r\nTherefore believing that the defect could reside within the TIU, this item was UxE (Upkeep by Exchange).\r\nThis cleared all the previous status error warnings but displayed “SNMP” down on:\r\n1. smcstiu1swnet1\r\n2. tcuaswnet1\r\n3. tcubswnet1\r\n4. CEN1\r\n\r\nHowever CEN1 could now be pinged on SMCS, TaLAN and by using command prompt using its name “CEN1” (DCHP) and indeed its ip address.\r\nFollowing an issue with WECDIS timing both TCU’s were taken down to re-establish the link, which resulted in a green “OK” being displayed. This remained green for 48hrs, which has not previously been observed on this platform. Only after having to again reset the TCU’s have we observed any warnings; that of the following:\r\n1. tcuaswnet1 SNMP down\r\n2. tcubswnet1 SNMP down\r\n\r\nThis however maybe due to the fact that only the TCU’s have been taken down and not the Backbones; however due to not having the documentation issued that refers to Zenoss the maintainers can’t seek any further guidance at sea (see Recommendations and Remarks section).\r\n"",""count"":1,""ratio"":3.6659578E-5},{""value"":""The problem seems to point to the interaction and use of the GUI and the failure of CEN2 to launch correctly from the last change over."",""count"":1,""ratio"":3.6659578E-5},{""value"":""  IT APPEARS THAT NO ONE IS WILLING TO USE THE MDA BUT INSTEAD OPT TO USE HYPERTERMINAL (OR EQUIVALENT) SETUP ON A STANDALONE LAPTOP AS OUTLINED ABOVE.

This time the unit displayed a “DC FAIL” indication and one of the fans was not operating along with the unit only display partial functionality but not producing a heading output.

You have to select and edit before telling the system to analyse it for acceptance into the decrypt queue.\r\nNormally the signal would drop straight in with no issues, error messages appear when analysing a retrieved grouper. Error messages that appear:  \r\n\r\nNo responsibility for message distribution \r\nFormat line 5 errors\r\n\r\nAlthough the “No responsibility for message distribution” message clears, the “format line 5” error does not and the signal requires loop back action. \r\n\r\nPrinting Decrypted Signals\r\n\r\nOn decrypting some signals the print command does not work meaning the operator has to copy the text into a plain message and print it from there. This leaves an imprint of the copied signal on the clipboard allowing the operator the ability to paste the classified imprint to any document.\r\n\r\nTime of Receipt Column\r\n\r\nTraffic that has been received on our accountable broadcast AZB and KZA drops into our queues based on their precedence as the system is set up to recognise our traffic. However we monitor other boats routines for intel purposes, and as such their traffic drops into the reject queue because the system isn’t set up to recognise every other boats traffic. \r\nAs there is such a large volume of traffic it would be advantageous to have a column in the reject queue that would allow us to sort all the signals into time of receipt, we already have message title / precedence / protective marking and date time group. With this extra column it would help us sort through the hundreds of signals that drop in to the system and allow us to quickly filter through and find the required traffic so we can provide command with the best service as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nCharacter Inversion\r\n\r\nOn occasion traffic received whilst in RTW mode takes a slight hit and distributes through VAMPS and ODC with number inversions. The solution was to remove the Ethernet cable from the port, wait and then re enter. On some occasions we had to reset the digital ports of the affected broadcast. Like the DRUMMER system has, to revert back to characters should be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic Distribution\r\n\r\nOn occasion, messages received on both secret and top secret were not dropping into the delivery queues. Reasons for this are unknown but on occasion the problem was isolated to the news and spor signals, this could be because system doesn’t like the length of the message. A full system reset was required on all occasions. On restart all messages would appear in there relevant queues. This becomes an issue as broadcasts can not be monitored for that period.\r\n\r\nDistribution to the Journal\r\n\r\nOn occasion some signals being received on the routine would not drop into the message journal, especially if they had been received before. This meant that if the some of the signal had been received garble the first time it would not drop in again meaning we could not take records. The solution around this is to loop back the signals on VAMPS. They would then individually drop into ODC allowing us to complete records.\r\n\r\nBroadcast Numbers\r\n\r\nWhen a signal has been correctly distributed to the message queue there are no broadcast numbers on the signals. It would be of great advantage to have this added allowing the operator greater control and accounting over signal traffic received.\r\n\r\nPlaindress Drafting \r\n\r\nThere is an issue with the plaindress message drafting function on VAMPS, whereby when entering multiple addresses into the system it  reorganised them into reverse order when saving the signal. To get around this issue, you have to enter the addresses in reverse order and when you submit your message, your messages will appear the way you want them. This will have to be done every time the message is altered. This issue will have to be rectified as it eradicates the plaindress drafting function.\r\n\r\nOn submission of a plaindress drafted signal to a transmit queue the system automatically provides the signal with an SSN. If the signal is removed from the queue for alteration and resubmitted a new SSN is given leaving a gap. \r\n\r\nThis and the previous issue regarding addresses going in reverse order has lead us to make the decision to use the free format function as our first method of drafting signals until these issues are rectified.\r\n\r\nDate Time Group\r\n\r\nAn ability to enter a DTG and line three that is in the future would greatly aid signal planning whilst deployed.\r\n"",""count"":1,""ratio"":3.6659578E-5},{""value"":""The software controlling DII backups should be modified to include an additional type of backup to be completed at set interrvals outside of  the current routines.

SS first attempted to recover CEN 1 by Relaunching from the Start Menu on a Multi-Function Console (MFC) logged in as maintainer, as advised in the SMCS PAID. After this failed to recover the affected node, maintainers then attempted to recover by using a Restart. CEN 1 recovered as far as the ‘Comms Ready’ stage, however even after waiting the advised 12 minutes it did not progress to ‘Time Available’. Finally, SS conducted a restart of SWIM Converter 1 (in Shared Cab (SCAB) A). This caused a full SMCS crash (with a fault code of F8502-971:201) indicating a failure of SWIM Converter Master/Slave arbitration. From this point, SS were able to recover as normal from a full crash following the guidance laid down in the PAID (SMCS R12.4 v3 (CCS Systems) “Dealing With SMCS Failures”).\r\n\r\nThis process repeated itself the following morning at exactly the same time (between 0335-0340Z). SS began investigating the cause of the routine Node Failures and discovered that during this window a large CPU spike could be seen on the Storage Area Networks (SANs) using the CSS Zenoss Health Monitoring tool. SS also observed significant spikes in network activity on Shared Computing Environment (SCE) 1 and 2 Fabric Switch A1 Ports 18 and 19, which connect the SCEs with the SANs. Over the following days it was observed that the size of these spikes varied, however they would frequently take SAN CPU usage above 90%, and raise Fabric Switch Network activity from 14.6 M bits/sec (average) to 36.2 M bits/sec. \r\n\r\nSS believe these issues align with the SAN Backup issue noted in HMS AUDACIOUS’ CCU (3.1.6.6 SMCS Crash F4606 fatal error (CS-6354)). \""\""It should be noted that there is a higher unquantifiable probability of SMCS crashes during the scheduled daily SAN backup.

The stanchion, in its state at the time of the fall, was considered to increase the likelihood of a hand slipping which would increase the chances of a fall.\r\nThe ladder was found to have grip tape (also referred to as ‘deck tread’) applied to all rungs with the exception of the third rung from the bottom. The grip tape on some of the rungs was worn and may have contributed to the likelihood of a fall. Whilst not considered to be a design feature, the use of grip tape has been normalised across the Submarine Service and is considered normal practice to apply grip tape to ladder rungs, it features on multiple ladders throughout the submarine. It is not possible to determine which rung of the ladder the IP’s feet were placed on when they fell, but given their shoulders were reported to be level with the deck above at the time of the fall, it could have been the rung without grip tape present. The installation and state of grip tape is considered to have contributed to the incident making a slip more likely to occur.\r\nStorage lockers are located behind the ladder on which the incident took place.
